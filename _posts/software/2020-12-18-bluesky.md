This week for the Research Software Encyclopedia Software Showcase we move into the world
of experiment orchestration and data management. This includes features like:

 - streaming data
 - metadata
 - cross-hardware compatibility
 - interruption recovery
 - suspend or resume
 - exportable formats
 - customization
 - interface with scientific python

If you too are like me and have never tried a library like this, I recommend
starting with the [tutorial](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/).

Are you already familiar with this software? We encourage you to contribute to the [research software encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rse/tutorials/annotation/) and annotate the respository:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

otherwise, keep reading!

## What is bluesky?

BlueSky is actually two things - the [BlueSky Project](https://blueskyproject.io/) is a community cenered around
experimental science, and [bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky/) is a software library that happens to belong
to this project. If you look at the image in the post above, it shows how different libraries (in blue) work together
to help you with your experiments. The BlueSky software (one of those libraries) is specifically the orchestration
component. It allows you to:

 - describe your experiment logic without needing to think about hardware
 - interact with (collect) streaming data
 - preserve metadata
 - pause or resume experiments

If you are not an instrumentalist or you've never worked with hardware, this library might seem very
different from what you usually see. This is exactly why we chose it for the RSEPedia software
showcase this week. Let's walk through a short example from the tutorial.



#### Why is it useful?

When doing some kind of analysis with living, changing data, it's important to not only be able to retrieve
it programatically, but also to be able to 
freeze the version of the data that you use. By downloading an entire snapshot in time, this makes
it easy to do your analysis over the dataset without having it change on you!

## How do I cite it?

The repository [DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02651) comes by way of Zenodo:

## How do I contribute to the software survey?

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_criteria }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software criteria</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ page.annotate_taxonomy }}" target="_blank">Annotate the software taxonomy</a></li>
</ul>

or read more about annotation [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/annotate-your-software). You can clone the software repository to do
bulk annotation, or annotation any repository in the <a href="https://rseng.github.io/software/" target="_blank">software database</a>,
We want annotation to be fun, straight-forward, and easy, so we will be showcasing one repository to annotate per week.
If you'd like to request annotation of a particular repository (or addition to the software database)
please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rseng/software/issues) or even a pull request.
